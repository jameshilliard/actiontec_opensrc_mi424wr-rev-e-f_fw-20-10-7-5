HOW TO BUILD A FIRMWARE FOR THE ACTIONTEC MC524 Router (MI424WR-GEN2 REV E/F)

* How to install the MC524 source code onto the Linux workstation
* How to build the image file that can be loaded on to a Actiontec MC524WR
* How to upgrade the MC524 with the new firmware image file.

NOTE: The following procedures are known to work with recent versions of 
Fedora, like versions 10, 11 or 12. Along with the Basic Fedora Install you 
will want to add the Software Developement packages that are provided with 
Fedora. 

The Actiontec MI424WR Rev. E & F Source Code, i386-jungo-linux-gnu compiler, 
mips64-octeon-toolchain and jpkg package can be obtained from the Actiontec 
support website at http://opensource.actiontec.com.

1. (Download source code, compilers and toolchain (4 files))

 actiontec_opensrc_mi424wr-rev-e-f_fw-20-10-7-5.tar.gz
 i386-jungo-linux-gnu.tar.gz
 toolchain-mips64-octeon_20070905.jpkg
 jpkg.tar.gz
 
2. (Copy or Move the source code to the HOME directory.)

$ cp actiontec_opensrc_mi424wr-rev-e-f_fw-20-10-7-5.tar.gz $HOME

3. (Change to the Home directory) 

$ cd $HOME

4. (Extract the contents of the source code)

$ tar zxvf actiontec_opensrc_mi424wr-rev-e-f_fw-20-10-7-5.tar.gz

IMPORTANT: Extracting the source code creates the directory "opensource-mc524" 
and the subdirectory "rg". The bulk of the source code resides in "rg". The 
Makefiles in the distribution expects that Jungo's openrg GCC 3.3.2 based 
compiler will be located at "/usr/local/openrg". Both the x86 
(i386-jungo-linux-gnu) and MIPS (mips64-octeon-linux-gnu) compilers should be 
installed to the "openrg" directory.

5. (The following commands assume that the User is still in the Home directory.) 

6. (Change to Super User for the following commands, requires the root password)

$ su - 
PASSWORD:

7. (Create the "openrg" directory at "/usr/local")

# mkdir /usr/local/openrg

8. (Move the compiler, toolchain and jpkg package to the "openrg" directory.)

# mv i386-jungo-linux-gnu.tar.gz /usr/local/openrg
# mv jpkg.tar.gz /usr/local/openrg
# mv toolchain-mips64-octeon_20070905.jpkg /usr/local/openrg

9. (Change to the "openrg" directory)

# cd /usr/local/openrg

10.(Extract the contents of the i386-jungo-linux-gnu compiler)

# tar zxvf i386-jungo-linux-gnu.tar.gz 

11.(Extract the contents of the jpkg package)

# tar zxvf jpkg.tar.gz

12.(Install and prepare the toolchain)

# ./jpkg -x -C / toolchain-mips64-octeon_20070905.jpkg

13.(Change to the original Home directory, the place-holder called <account>, 
represents the name of the account you were using before you changed to Super 
User, earlier in these directions. If your login is "bobby", then there will 
be a directory within the Home directory named "bobby", and that is where you 
will find the "/opensource-mc524/rg" directory. If so, the command would look 
like this: "cd /home/bobby/opensource-mc524/rg".)

# cd /home/<account>/opensource-mc524/rg

14.(When you have changed to the "rg" directory, the following command will 
build the new image.)

# make config CONFIG_RG_GPL=y DIST=MC524WR LIC=../jpkg_actiontec_gpl.lic && make



HOW TO UPLOAD THE IMAGE TO THE ROUTER

IMPORTANT: In order to load the firmware onto the router, the user will need 
a serial debug board and a TFTP server.

1. Set up the TFTP server, copy the newly created "vmlinux" file from the 
build to TFTP server folder.

2. Boot up the Router with serial debug connected to PC. 

3. Press Enter continuously to enter bootloader prompt.

4. Set environment variables (if they're not set) to load from tftp:

    set serverip <TFTP server IP>

    set ipaddr <IP address>

5. Load the firmware using TFTP:

    run small_ram
    run unzip_prep
    tftp 0x1000000 vmlinux

6. Run boot command:

    bootoctlinux 0x1000000 numcores=2
